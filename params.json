Our program, GFDS, is free and meets for six weeks, half a day each. We produced this curriculum for girls who would like to attend or who have attended this program.\r\n## What is Unity 3D?\r\nUnity 3D is a free program that allows users to create any 2D or 3D interactive game with characters and objects. Users can use one of a variety programming languages, such as C#, JavaScript, C, C++, Python, and Boo. In Girls First Digital Studio (GFDS), we create games using the language C#.\r\n## What is Blender?\r\nBlender is a free and open sourced 3D modeling software that enables its users to create objects and designs of their own. In GFDS, we create ships using Blender and install them into Unity for our games.\r\n\r\n## Introduction to C# \r\n### Variables\r\n- Def: A storage of a value (number, words, etc)\r\n- Think of a variable like an envelope it holds anything you put inside of it\r\n\r\n### Types of Variables \r\n- Int - Stores integers (whole number negative and positive)\r\n\t* public int year = 365;\r\n-  Boolean - Stores true or false values\r\n\t* public bool hired = true;\r\n-  Float - Stores decimal numbers\r\n\t* public float speed = .5f;\r\n\r\n## Game #1: Introduction to Game Development and Unity\r\n- Downloading Unity and Blender\r\n- Editor tour\r\n- Navigation through Unity setup (e.g. Scene, Game, Directional Light, Console, Project, Asset Store, Inspector),\r\n- Learning about Components, which are used to manipulate Game Objects (e.g. RigidBody, Collider, Transform, Mesh Renderer)\r\n  - Adding Rigidbody 2D (Physics to the object)\r\n  - Adding box Collider 2D (Physics to the object)\r\n- Learning to build simple game from 3D primitives\r\n- Learning to create objects (Cube, players)\r\n- Learning to write a C# Script (CubeMove) for moving the cube in four directions by pressing down certain keys\r\n- Creating and using Microsoft OneDrive Accounts to save projects\r\n\r\n## CubeMove Script:\r\n```\r\nusing UnityEngine;\r\nusing System.Collections;\r\n\t\r\npublic class CubeMove : MonoBehaviour {\r\n\tpublic float speed = .5f;\r\n\t\r\n\t// Use this for initialization\r\n\tvoid Start () {\t\r\n\t}\r\n\t//Update is called once per frame\r\n\tvoid Update () {\r\n\r\n\t    if(Input.GetKey(KeyCode.W)){\r\n\t\t\t    transform.position += new Vector3 (0, 0, speed);\r\n\t\t  }\r\n\t\t  if(Input.GetKey(KeyCode.S)){\r\n\t\t\t    transform.position += new Vector3 (0, 0, -speed);\r\n\t\t  }\r\n\t\t  if(Input.GetKey(KeyCode.A)){\r\n\t\t\t    transform.position += new Vector3 (-speed, 0, 0);\r\n\t\t  }\r\n\t\t  if(Input.GetKey(KeyCode.D)){\r\n\t\t\t    transform.position += new Vector3 (speed, 0, 0);\r\n\t\t  }\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Development on Basic Game Objects Created\r\n- Learning to use the Game Manager\r\n- Creation of new cubes and learning how to change their properties\r\n  - Stretching them into rectangles (Transform Component)\r\n  - Adding various components to the objects-- Rigidbody, Colliders  \r\n- Introduction to Standard assets (e.g. Materials)\r\n  - We learn to add color and paste pictures onto objects by creating a folder, “Materials” in our Assets folder\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2016-09-03 at 1 44 52 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21973154/18226670/13350918-71dd-11e6-8760-47571470e0ec.png)\r\n\r\n## Introduction to New Objects and Scripts\r\n- Creating C# Scripts (“Danger Zone”, “Enemy”) and attaching them to the new cubes we had created\r\n- “Enemy”- a pickup system. Collects objects when the player collides with object\r\n- “Danger Zone”- the player dies when it triggers the danger zone (Red Area)\r\n\r\n## Enemy Script:\r\n```\r\nusing UnityEngine;\r\nusing System.Collections;\r\nusing UnityEngine.UI;\r\n\r\npublic class Enemy : MonoBehaviour {\r\n\r\n      // Use this for initialization\r\n      void Start () {\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      // Update is called once per frame\r\n      void Update () {\r\n        }\r\n\r\n      void OnTriggerEnter(Collider obj){\r\n            CubeMove.lives -= 1;\r\n            Destroy (obj.gameObject);\r\n            Application.LoadLevel(0);\r\n        }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n## DangerZone Script:\r\n```\r\nusing UnityEngine;\r\nusing System.Collections;\r\nusing UnityEngine.UI;\r\n\r\npublic class DangerZone : MonoBehaviour {\r\n\r\n    // Use this for initialization\r\n    void Start () {\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // Update is called once per frame\r\n    void Update () {\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    void OnTriggerEnter(Collider obj){\r\n        if (obj.tag == \"player\") {\r\n           Destroy (obj.gameObject);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Adding Lives and Reloading Level\r\n- Updating CubeMove by adding variables speed and lives. \r\n\t* Setting the “speed” to a certain constant allows us to control how fast the cube will move when we activate the right keys (recall: CubeMove script).\r\n\t* We want our game to have a certain lives count so that the game is over when that lives count reaches 0. Otherwise, the game would never end.\r\n\t\r\n```\r\nusing UnityEngine;\r\nusing System.Collections;\r\n\r\npublic class CubeMove : MonoBehavior {\r\n      public float speed = .5f;\r\n      public static int lives=3;\r\n    // Use this for initialization \r\n      void Start (){\r\n      }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Application.LoadLevel()--reloading the game/level\r\n\t* Learning to use Build Settings--which allows us to reload the level\r\n\t* Learning to use Unity API--this is a website that allows us to search for functions or other Unity/coding tools in case we forget\r\n\t\r\n```\r\nvoid Update () {\r\n      }\r\nvoid OnTriggerEnter(Collider obj){\r\n\tDestroy (obj.gameObject);\r\n        Application.LoadLevel(\"Game\");\r\n      }\r\n```\r\n(This belongs on the Enemy script and makes it reset the level when you touch (collide) the player object with the enemy object.)\r\n\r\n- Adding a Canvas and text to the game (such as “Lives: ” and “Game Over!”\r\n\t* Using Mesh Renderer and adding code to Enemy script to enable “Game Over!” to only appear after the lives count reaches 0.\r\n\r\n##  Updated CubeMove Script\r\n```\r\nusing UnityEngine;\r\nusing System.Collections;\r\n\r\npublic class CubeMove : MonoBehaviour {\r\n      public float speed = .5f;\r\n      public static int lives=3;\r\n      // Use this for initialization\r\n      void Start () {\r\n    }\r\n\r\n      // Update is called once per frame\r\n      void Update () {\r\n\r\n            if(Input.GetKey(KeyCode.W)){\r\n                  transform.position += new Vector3 (0, 0, speed);\r\n            }\r\n            if(Input.GetKey(KeyCode.S)){\r\n                  transform.position += new Vector3 (0, 0, -speed);\r\n            }\r\n            if(Input.GetKey(KeyCode.A)){\r\n                  transform.position += new Vector3 (-speed, 0, 0);\r\n            }\r\n            if(Input.GetKey(KeyCode.D)){\r\n                  transform.position += new Vector3 (speed, 0, 0);\r\n              }\r\n        }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n(Using the variable Speed it’s able to change the speed of the controls. Lives is also created to keep track of how many lives are in the game at that moment.)\r\n\r\n## Updated Enemy Script\r\n```\r\nusing UnityEngine;\r\nusing System.Collections;\r\nusing UnityEngine.UI;\r\n\r\npublic class Enemy : MonoBehaviour {\r\n    public Text text;\r\n      // Use this for initialization\r\n      void Start () {\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      // Update is called once per frame\r\n      void Update () {\r\n            if (CubeMove.lives == 0) {\r\n                  text.enabled = true;\r\n            }\r\n      }\r\n      void OnTriggerEnter(Collider obj){\r\n            CubeMove.lives -= 1;\r\n            Destroy (obj.gameObject);\r\n            Application.LoadLevel(0);\r\n        }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Game #2: Introduction to Blender and Blender 3D Repository\r\n- Introduction to Blender, an open-sourced program that allows users to create their own objects\r\n\t* Using Blender to create our own ship designs and installing them into Unity\r\n\t* Adding CubeMove Script to ship\r\n- Introduction to the Terrain tool in Unity\r\n\t* Building a terrain for Blender object in Unity (i.e. ship on a terrain of icebergs)\r\n- Used various images from Google Images for game design\r\n- Here is a model game that shows what we learned:\r\nhttps://twitter.com/albertolacon/status/739535527339163648\r\n\r\n##  A New Game: Using AI Technology\r\n- Writing code (“AI Controller”) for an object (a cube) to be able to move forward by itself (without the help of a pressed down key)\r\n\t* Rotating the object 45 degrees when it touched the wall (using creating a Wall Controller code)\r\n- Fixing a 3D image of an animal onto our self-moving object (because cubes don’t move on their own) so that it appears that the only thing moving is the animal\r\n\t* Using Blender 3D Model Repository to upload 3D Models into Unity\r\n\t* Parenting the 3D Model to the AI cube into order to place the 3D model on top of the cube\r\n\t* Using Mesh Renderer to make the cube invisible and make only the 3D model visible\r\n- Creating background using Google Images (e.g. sand and water)\r\n- Creating an object that chases the original object (by writing an AI2 Controller Script)\r\n\r\n## AIController Script\r\n```\r\nusing UnityEngine;\r\nusing System.Collections;\r\n\r\npublic class AIController : MonoBehaviour {\r\n      public float speed = 2.0f;\r\n        // Use this for initialization\r\n        void Start () {\r\n        }\r\n        // Update is called once per frame\r\n        void Update () {\r\n             transform.Translate (Vector3.forward * Time.deltaTime * speed);\r\n      }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## AI2Controller Script\r\n```\r\nusing UnityEngine;\r\nusing System.Collections;\r\n\r\npublic class AI2Controller : MonoBehaviour {\r\n\r\n    //these are comments\r\n    \r\n    //saves the object that you want to follow as a Transform and is called target.
